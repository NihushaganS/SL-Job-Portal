<b>Introduction:</b>
<br>
In today's world, finding the right job can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. That's
why we are super excited to introduce our project: a brand-new job portal. We are setting out to
create something that's not just another job site, but a game-changer for both job seekers and
employers.
Our project is all about helping people navigate their career paths with confidence and
connecting employers with the talent they need. <br>

<b>Background</b>
<br>
We decided to work on this project because we've seen firsthand how frustrating it can be to
search for jobs online. The existing platforms often feel outdated and clunky, making it hard to
find relevant opportunities. We wanted to change that by building a modern, user-friendly app
that addresses the needs of both job seekers and employers.
